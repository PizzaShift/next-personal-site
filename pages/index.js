                Hi üëãÔ∏è! If you hadn't noticed, I'm Dakota. The mind behind this
                and many other projects. This, is my little corner of the
                internet. My eventual goal for this site is to be able to
                publish and share everything interesting I find around here.
                Whether that be books, articles, videos, music. You name it. I
                love seeing the amount of passion people put into their work,
                and aspire to be able to give just a little bit back to them. If
                you would like to see my progress, I maintain a kanban board for
                this project{" "}
                <a
                  style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
                  href="https://github.com/IamFlowZ/next-personal-site/projects/1"
                >
                  here in the projects repository.
